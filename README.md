# Automagic Architect Contribution Guidelines

Automagic Architect is open to community improvements, but it is intended to remain a single, unified mod. Please read the following before contributing.

## Overview

Automagic Architect is an automated construction system for Crusader Kings 3 designed to remove the repetitive workload of manual building. The mod upgrades and develops holdings across your realm automatically, including castles, cities, temples, and vassal domains. It follows vanilla game rules, innovations, culture checks, building requirements, and terrain restrictions while allowing instant or fully automated progression.

The system uses scripted effects and an in-game GUI for easy control, supports a wide range of buildings, and handles upgrades intelligently up to the highest level allowed by technology. The mod also includes extensive localisation support, with more translations welcome.

This GitHub repository exists to support improvements to the logic, performance, compatibility, localisation, code clarity, and optional features of the mod, while ensuring the official version stays consistent and centralised.

## Allowed Contributions

You may fork the repository for the purpose of contributing improvements such as:
- new features  
- optimisation  
- bug fixes  
- localisation work  
- improved logic checks  
- building support additions  
- optional settings  
- quality of life improvements  
- alternative behaviour options such as non instant building modes  

Forking for personal development and contribution is completely fine.

All accepted contributions will be credited.

## Private Use

You are welcome to modify the mod privately for your own gameplay.  
You may also share snippets, ideas, or improvements if you think they should be included in the official version.

## Not Allowed

To protect the integrity and identity of the mod, the following is not permitted:

- Publishing your fork or edited version as a separate mod on Steam, Paradox Mods, Nexus, or any public website  
- Creating derivative mods based on this code or structure  
- Reuploading this mod under a different name  
- Reusing the clrbnit_magic namespace in any publicly released project  
- Copying or repackaging the logic, effects, or structure to create a new stand alone mod  
- Presenting modified versions as separate or improved projects  

In simple terms: collaboration is welcome, but duplication or repackaging is not.
